### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Florian FÃ¼lling from Germany. You often find me using the names Chojo or Hadde when I am somewhere around in the internet (Except here for no reason).

I am passionate about Java and SQL (yes...). Also like nearly everyone I want to do more stuff than I have time left.

I mainly work on plugins published under my [Eldoria RPG](https://github.com/eldoriarpg) organisation. Feel free to check it out.

If you want to contact me, the fastest way is via Discord ([Chojo#0001](https://discordapp.com/users/214347948316819456/))
